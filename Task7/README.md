This is a command line interface tool using the click library to allow the users to download subtitles of a movie. They can filter the subtitles by language, file size, and movie hash. The hash of a movie file is also calculated using hashlib. This program takes the subtitles from opensubtitles using beautifulsoup and requests. It takes these subtitles, displays them, and allows the user to select. The user can download the selected subtitles in the output folder of their choice. You can also batch process all the movie files in a directory. The things I learned from doing this program is pretty much everything above, like how to build a CLI application for users. How to use beautifulsoup, requests, and how to parse HTML to extract the subtitles. Just like the previous program, it helped me to do file handling, working with movie files, calculating hash for the first time, and downloading subtitles. Finally, file hashes and batch processing were completely new concepts to me as well.
