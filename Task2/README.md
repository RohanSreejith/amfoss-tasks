This task helped me learn a lot about all the commands in the terminal of linux. It gave me experience in using it, because I this was the first task and I got stuck on it quite a lot. I kept going forward and backward with all the commands. Especially the grep command, because genuinely everytime I used the grep command, I kept getting a different result. But finally, I decided to get help from ChatGPT, and thats when I found out the problem in the syntax of the way that I was using the grep command. The rest of the task was fine, I am farely comfortable with using the commands like cd, ls, mkdir, mv, cp, rm, cat ,nano, git push, clear, git branch, and git checkout. These are the ones that I used the most, but I enjoyed doing this task because it felt more like an IQ puzzle of some sort, than an actual computer task.
