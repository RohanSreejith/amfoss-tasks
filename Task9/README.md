In this task, it is still a work in process because I kept getting an error from Flutter, and I didn't get enough time. I read a little about flutter, the open source UI to make softwares and downloaded it. Also, I didn't know how to write in Dart either, so I had to learn a lot about that too. I am also using VS Code which I configured for flutter. In the terminal, I created a new flutter projet and started designing the Main Screen, but I didn't get enough time to use the JSON file from the assets folder and do the rest. But I have an idea how to do it now, which I will definitely continue after submitting this.
