ABOUT ME
Hi, my name is Rohan Sreejith. I am a CSE AI student in S1 from Trivandrum, Kerala. I am a very big sports, car and tech guy. I am a very big car enthusiast, and follow sports like cricket and football. I have a couple of hobbies too. I play the piano and cello, and I am trying to learn to sing. I love coding because I find puzzles and stuff like that fun.

WHY SHOULD WE CHOOSE YOU?
You should choose me because I am a hardworker and have really put my all into trying to get into am-Foss. I really love coding, am eager to keep learning new things, and finally I am a great team worker and love to work with a great team. I am willing to use all my time and push myself to become the best version of myself. 

WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS? HOW WILL YOU ACCOMPLISH THEM?
In the next 6 months, I really want to continue to develop my coding skills and be able to make more complex AI programs without any help, and a big goal of mine is to start doing hackathons and competitive programming. I am already doing multiple courses in parallel with all the tasks and class work to continue to improve myself and keep learning new things. I plan to continue to find different courses like these for python and other languages to eventually become a expert coder. Eventually, this will help me to do well in different hackathons and other competitions. 

HOW WILL YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I will contribute to the club by continuing to learn and become a really good coder. This will allow to me to share my knowledge with others in the club, participate in all the club activites, and also I think my positive and dedicated mindset will definitely help influence the club in the right direction.

HAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND FEEDBACK ON THE PRAVESHAN SELECTION PROCESS?
I personally really enjoyed the Praveshan selection process. Before going through this praveshan selection process, I was very limited in coding and almost every single task game me a big challenge. Espeically the pagepal task (task 4) took me around a week to even figure it out. I was trying to do all these tasks with just basic coding knowledge. I was nervous about the weekly meetings, because I didn't want to say anything dumb and ruin my chances of getting in to am-Foss. But honestly, the mentors was great, and they were extremely supportive. They helped me by telling me what all things I could work on during every meeting. They were extremely friendly, and I really appretiate their willingness to help. At some points, I personally thought I wasn't good enought and should quit, but now that we are at the end, I feel like these tasks have worked wonders on the way I program now.
