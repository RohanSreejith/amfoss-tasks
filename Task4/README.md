In this program, I set up a bot using the telegram API, so it can interact with users. This program has many commands for multiple functions like /start, /help, /book, /preview, /reading_list. The bot can find books using the google books API, and return information of the book as a CSV file. So, in this program, I learned how to use API and send requests using Google Books APi. Secondly, I learned how to generate and work with CSV files. This is also the first interactive bot program that I made. It also helped to learn how to work with the Telegram API, but I don't know how helpful that is because there are rumours it will get banned.
