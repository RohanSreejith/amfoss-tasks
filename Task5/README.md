This is a very simple code written using Javascript, html, and css. I will go through my thought process of what I did to write this program. First, there is a fetchProducts function to get the data from the API that I called. It uses the GET request to the API to get the data and store it in an array after sorting it. Also, if there is any error that happens, there is also error handling to catch it. Then, there is an event listener to find when a key is pressed and it automatically calls the processCommand function to do according. There is also a function for when each command is typed. For example, when you type list, the listProducts function is used, and so forth. Finally, there is an appendToOutput function to make sure the output is written and displayed properly and scrolls down to the bottom.
